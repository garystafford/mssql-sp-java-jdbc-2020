# Calling Microsoft SQL Server Stored Procedures from a Java Application Using JDBC (2020 Edition)

Demonstrate the use of the JDBC to call stored procedures from a Microsoft SQL Server database and return data to a Java-based console application. An update of the original blog post, [Calling Microsoft SQL Server Stored Procedures from a Java Application Using JDBC](https://programmaticponderings.com/2012/08/24/calling-sql-server-stored-procedures-with-java-using-jdbc/), and GitHub project files, [mssql-sp-java-jdbc](https://github.com/garystafford/mssql-sp-java-jdbc), published August 24, 2012.

* Demonstrate the differences between using static sql statements and stored procedures to return data
* Demonstrate the use of three types of the JDBC statements to return data: Statement, PreparedStatement, and CallableStatement
* Demonstrate how to call stored procedures with input and output parameters
* Demonstrate how to return either single values, or a result set from a database using a stored procedure

## Major Changes to Project

* __Platform__: Originally MS SQL Server ran locally, now Microsoft SQL Server on Amazon RDS
* __Microsoft SQL Server__: Originally based on SQL Server 2008 R2 (10.50.1600.1), now SQL Server 2017 (14.00.3281.6.v1)
* __JDBC Driver__: Originally built with Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.0 for SQL Server (JDBC 4.0 for JRE 6), now Microsoft JDBC Driver 8.4 for SQL Server (JDBC Driver 8.4 for JRE 11)
* __Database__: Originally based on AdventureWorks2008R2, now AdventureWorks2017 (OLTP) full database
* __Java__: Originally built with Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 6, now Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 13
* __IDE__: Originally built with Netbeans 7.1.2, now IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 (Ultimate Edition)
* __Build Automation Tool__: Originally built with Apache Ant, now Gradle 6.6.1

## Scripts

* `RestoreAdventureWorksBackUp.sql`: Example of running full restore of AdventureWorks backup (.BAK) from Amazon S3, and checking progress (you must have enabled and configured native backup and restore)
* `RunStoredProcedures.sql`: Run all stored procedures, after they are installed.
* `ClearCache.sql`: Running DBCC `FREESYSTEMCACHE` clears the plan cache

## Commands

```bash
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
./gradlew cleanTest test
./gradlew run --warning-mode none
```
